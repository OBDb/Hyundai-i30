    description: "The original Hyundai i30 was introduced as a compact car (C-segment) primarily for European markets, though also sold in Australia and some Asian countries (as the Elantra in some regions). Designed at Hyundai's European center in RÃ¼sselsheim, Germany, it featured conventional but European-influenced styling to compete directly with established models like the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus. Available in five-door hatchback and later station wagon body styles, it offered good interior space and practicality. Engine options varied by market but typically included petrol units ranging from 1.4L to a 2.0L, plus diesel options that were particularly important for European buyers. The interior was straightforward with decent materials and build quality for its price point. This generation established the i30 as Hyundai's first serious competitor in the European C-segment, winning praise for its value, practicality, and five-year warranty."

  - name: "Second Generation (GD)"

    end_year: 2017
    description: "The second-generation i30 adopted Hyundai's 'Fluidic Sculpture' design language, featuring more dynamic styling with flowing lines and a distinctive hexagonal grille. Available in five-door hatchback, three-door hatchback, and station wagon body styles, it offered more options for different buyer preferences. Engine choices evolved to include more efficient units with better performance, including new turbocharged options in some markets. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, featuring a more premium appearance with soft-touch materials and available features including touchscreen infotainment and dual-zone climate control. Safety features expanded to include up to nine airbags and advanced driver assistance systems on higher trims. This generation elevated the i30's market position, offering comparable quality and features to established European competitors while maintaining a value advantage."

    end_year: null
    description: "The current i30 features more restrained styling compared to its predecessor, adopting a cleaner, more mature design language with a cascading grille that became a Hyundai signature element. Available in five-door hatchback, station wagon (Tourer), and fastback body styles, plus the high-performance N variant, it offers more choices than ever before. Engine options increasingly focus on efficiency with a range of turbocharged petrol and diesel units, many featuring mild-hybrid technology in later years to reduce emissions. The interior represents a significant step up with higher quality materials, a more horizontal dashboard design, and improved technology including an available 8-inch touchscreen with navigation and smartphone integration. Safety technology has advanced considerably with Hyundai SmartSense features including autonomous emergency braking, lane keep assist, and driver attention warning available across the range. The introduction of the i30 N performance model with up to 280 HP also established the nameplate in the hot hatch segment, bringing driving enjoyment and emotional appeal to complement the model's traditional strengths of practicality and value. A significant facelift in 2020 updated the styling, interior technology, and engine lineup to maintain competitiveness in the challenging European C-segment."
